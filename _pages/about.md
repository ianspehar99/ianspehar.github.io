About Me
======
I graduated from Oregon State University with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, and have returned to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree in the same field, with a focus on robotics. My passion lies in using technology to make a positive impact on the world, with a particular interest in renewable energy and environmental sustainability. For my thesis, I am working under Dr. Richard Wirz, conducting research on manufacturing plasma-resistant materials. This work aims to develop advanced vacuum chamber environments that support testing for fusion power technology, contributing to innovative solutions in sustainable energy.
