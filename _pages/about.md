#About Me

I graduated from Oregon State University with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering, and have returned to pursue a Masterâ€™s degree in the same field, with a focus on robotics. My passion lies in using robot technology to make a positive impact on the world, with a particular interest in renewable energy and environmental sustainability. 

For my thesis, I am working under Dr. Richard Wirz, conducting research on manufacturing plasma-resistant materials. This work aims to develop advanced vacuum chamber environments that support testing for fusion power technology, contributing to innovative solutions in sustainable energy.

I mainly specialize in software development for robot intelligence. Check out my portfolio and resume for more details, and please feel free to email me with any questions!
